                <p>c. <strong>Effective Date:</strong> This Agreement shall be deemed effective as of the date first

                <h2 id="article2">ARTICLE 2: DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</h2>

                <p>During the development of the Online Application (including prior development which might include but
                    not limited to discussing the development plan, Desings and quotation) the Disclosing Party may
                    disclose Confidential Information to the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party shall always hold
                    and maintain the same in strict confidence. The obligations under this Agreement shall continue
                    perpetually and the Receiving Party's duty to hold in confidence the Confidential Information that
                    was disclosed during the course of the development of the Online Application shall remain in effect
                    for an indefinite period. (Including any information received during any initial discussions of the
                    Online Application ideas)</p>

                <p>The Confidential Information is provided "as is" and the Disclosing Party disclaims any implied
                    warranties related to any Confidential Information disclosed hereunder.</p>

                <h2 id="article3">ARTICLE 3: OBLIGATIONS OF THE RECEIVING PARTY</h2>

                <p>The Receiving Party shall share the Confidential Information to their Representatives only on a 'need
                    to know' basis. The Receiving Party shall advise its Representatives regarding the proprietary
                    nature of the Confidential Information and the obligations set forth in this Agreement that requires
                    such Representatives to be bound by written confidentiality restrictions no less stringent than
                    those contained herein and implement all necessary measures to prevent disclosure of Confidential
                    Information by its Representatives.</p>

                <p>Prior to giving access to the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall notify in writing
                    the identity of the Representatives to whom the Confidential Information is going to be disclosed
                    and shall ensure the protection of such Confidential Information using reasonable measures to
                    maintain its confidentiality.</p>

                <p>The Receiving Party shall at all times remain liable for any actions of the Representatives that
                    would constitute a confidentiality breach and the Receiving Party shall assume full liability for
                    acts or omissions by its Representatives that are inconsistent with its obligations under this
                    Agreement.</p>

                <p>The Receiving Party shall keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential by using a
                    reasonable degree of care, but not less than the degree of care used by it in safeguarding its own
                    confidential information. The Receiving Party shall not make any copies or reproduce in any form any
                    Confidential Information except for the permitted purpose in accordance with this Agreement.</p>

                <p>The Receiving Party hereby agrees to use the Confidential Information solely in connection with the
                    development of the Online Application and not for any purpose other than as authorized by this
                    Agreement. No other right or license, whether expressed or implied, in the Confidential Information
                    is granted to the Receiving Party hereunder.</p>

                <p>The title to the Confidential Information shall remain solely with the Disclosing Party and all use
                    of Confidential Information by the Receiving Party shall be for the benefit of the Disclosing Party
                    and any modifications and improvements thereof by the Receiving Party shall be the sole property of
                    the Disclosing Party. Subject to the rights of any third party, all intellectual property rights
                    related to the Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement shall be and shall remain the
                    property of the Disclosing Party.</p>

                <p>Notwithstanding the above Effective Date, the Receiving Party hereby agrees and acknowledges that the
                    obligation to maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence as per this Agreement shall
                    also extend to such Confidential Information disclosed before the Effective Date of this Agreement.
                </p>

                <h2 id="article4">ARTICLE 4: REMEDIES</h2>

                <p>The Receiving Party hereby acknowledges that: (i) the Confidential Information to be disclosed
                    hereunder is of a unique and valuable nature and disclosure of the Confidential Information can
                    cause considerable commercial and financial detriment to the Disclosing Party, and due to the unique
                    nature there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder; (ii) any
                    such breach may allow the Receiving Party or third parties to unfairly compete with the Disclosing
                    Party resulting in irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party; (iii) upon any such breach or any
                    threat thereof, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition
                    to whatever remedies it might have at law and to be indemnified by the Receiving Party from any loss
                    or harm, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, in connection with any breach or
                    enforcement of the Receiving Party's obligations hereunder or the unauthorized use or release of any
                    such Confidential Information.</p>

                <p>Upon discovery or suspicion of disclosure or unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the
                    Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall immediately notify the Disclosing Party regarding such
                    incidents and shall cooperate with any and all efforts of the Disclosing Party to help the
                    Disclosing Party regain possession of Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized
                    use.</p>

                <p>The Receiving Party hereby agrees to bear all its costs and expenses incurred for the performance of
                    its obligations under this Agreement and shall not have any right to any reimbursement of costs,
                    expenses whatsoever incurred or payment of compensation in connection with this Agreement.</p>

                <h2 id="article5">ARTICLE 5: INDEMNIFICATION</h2>

                <p>The Receiving Party hereby agrees to fully indemnify the Disclosing Party in respect of any claim,
                    liability, loss, damage, costs, and expenses incurred directly or indirectly by the Disclosing Party
                    due to: (i) breach of any terms of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; or (ii) failure from the
                    part of the Receiving Party to hold the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in
                    confidence.</p>
